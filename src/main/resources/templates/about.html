                      The Book Club App originated as a group of three who would meet in the Bellevue
                      University library to discuss their favorite books. This small group started to
                      grow as others took notice of the discussion and would chime in.

                  <p class="lead text-muted">
                      As this club originated at college they wanted to create a way to keep the discussions
                      going as they moved on with life and careers. That's how the idea behind this app
                      was formed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="lead text-muted">
                      The app has since formed into more than just a way to continue discussions. We also
                      created a format that hopefully helps others start book clubs in their own
                      area. Building community through books and diverse discussion.
